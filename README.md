# Tapi River Insights: Sustainable Water Management

## Project Overview
This repository contains the research work **"Tapi River Sustainability: Surat's Lifeline and Beyond"**, conducted by students of M.Sc. (Applied Statistics) semester-4 at Veer Narmad South Gujarat University (V.N.S.G.U.), Surat, Gujarat.

### Project Group:
- **Dekani Nikunjkumar**
- **Mayat Sadiya**
- **Rakholiya Dhruvi**
- **Sukla Atish**
- **Trivedi Nirav**

**Project Guide:** Sahil Merai  
**Project Year:** 2023-24

## Introduction
This study utilizes satellite imagery to analyze the sustainability of the Tapi River, focusing on turbidity levels and river width changes. It contributes to:
- **Goal 14** (Life Below Water)
- **Goal 11** (Sustainable Cities and Communities)
- **Goal 15** (Life on Land)
- **Goal 6** (Clean Water and Sanitation)
- **Goal 3** (Good Health and Well-being)
- **Goal 13** (Climate Action)

Understanding these dynamics aids in pollution control, urban planning, and conservation efforts for sustainable river management.

## Study Area: Tapi River, Surat City
Surat is a major commercial hub in Gujarat, where the **Tapi River spans ~20 km**. **Remote sensing** plays a vital role in tracking water quality and changes, supporting conservation efforts.

## Research Methodology
- **Data Source:** Sentinel-2 satellite imagery
- **Techniques:**
  - **Normalized Difference Turbidity Index (NDTI):** Assessing water quality
  - **Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI):** Identifying water bodies
  - **Heatmap Analysis:** Identifying high and low turbidity zones
  - **Historical Analysis:** River width variations from 1987 to 2021

## Key Findings
### 1. Turbidity Trends (2019-2023)
- **Highest turbidity** at **Dabholi Bridge (May 2023)**
- **Lowest turbidity** at **Dummas Road-2 (January 2023)**
- **Post-monsoon peaks (October-December), declines in winter & summer**
- **Stable zones:** Kathor, Savji Korat Bridge
- **Fluctuating zones:** Amboli

### 2. River Width Variability (1987-2021)
- **Widest point:** Jahangirpura (2002)
- **Narrowest point:** Gorat (2020)
- **Stable areas:** Kamrej, Rustombaug to Adajan Bridge
- **Significant fluctuations:** Jahangirpura, Variyav Bridge to Dabholi Bridge

**Recent Observations: The Rundh area has seen a steady increase in width since 1987, whereas the Chowk-Bazar area has fluctuated but remained relatively constant.**

## SDG Alignment
- **Goal 14**: Monitoring water quality and pollution control
- **Goal 11**: Sustainable urban planning along the river
- **Goal 15**: Biodiversity conservation and ecosystem health
- **Goal 6**: Ensuring clean water supply
- **Goal 3**: Reducing health risks linked to water pollution
- **Goal 13**: Adapting to climate-driven river changes

## Policy Recommendations
- **Integrated River Management:** Combining pollution control and urban planning
- **Stricter Water Quality Standards:** Regular monitoring and enforcement
- **Sustainable Riverfront Development:** Eco-friendly urban infrastructure
- **Public Awareness:** Educating communities on river conservation
- **Remote Sensing-Based Decision Making:** Using real-time data for policy action

## Future Work & Recommendations
- **Long-Term Monitoring:** Continuous tracking of river width and turbidity
- **Expanded Water Quality Assessments:** Identifying pollution hotspots
- **IoT-Based Monitoring:** Deploying sensors for real-time data collection
- **Sustainable Urban Development:** Enhancing green infrastructure along stable riverfront areas

## Conclusion
The research highlights the critical need for **sustainable water management** using remote sensing. Surat must prioritize water conservation efforts, strict pollution controls, and data-driven policy-making to ensure the Tapi River‚Äôs long-term health.
